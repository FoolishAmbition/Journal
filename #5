*This VBA macro calculates the total billable hours and total amount for each candidate in a report and outputs the results to a new sheet called "CandidateTotals".*

Context:
During the early stages of the implementation of the new payroll system, raw data was messy, and needed cleaning. This macro helped the entire payroll department
to save time on sorting through the messy excel file. I made this code in hopes of helping the entire deparment to leave home early instead of working through messy data
files. It was then shared throughout the entire department through the approval of the director.

Usage:
1
Selects the Worksheet named "report" where the candidate data is stored

2
Identifies the Last Row in Column A (Candidate Name) to determine the range of dat

3
Defines three key columns:
Column A → Candidate names
Column G → Billable hours
Column K → Pay/hour 

4
Creates 2 Dictionaries to store total billable hours and total amounts for each candidate

5
For each candidate in Column A,:
Checks if the candidate exists in the dictionary (if not, initializes them)
Adds the billable hours from Column G
Adds the total amount from Column K

6
Checks if a sheet named "CandidateTotals" exists:
If it does, it selects it
If not, it creates a new sheet and names it "CandidateTotals".

7
Writes headers to "CandidateTotals" (Row 1)
Loops through each candidate and writes:
Candidate name in Column A
Total billable hours in Column B
Total amount in Column C
