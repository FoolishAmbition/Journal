creating modules for stuff i find interesting and useful for myself

#update
Was in the BMT army for 4 months (PTP), unable to freely access the internet, coded small projects whenever i could.
I'm in combat unit now, trying my best to squeeze whatever admin time that i have into coding, and maintaining my social life.
Will be uploading codes/scripts that I have used previously before - which are saved during my internships and in the past.
