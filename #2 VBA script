This VBA and Excel formula will allow you to check whether the cell that you are looking at, exists in the driver/folder that you provide.
I used this to check 3000 entries whether the correct file entry exists on the file directory on the company's internal files.
This VBA script has saved me hours on time, and also completing my work early.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Function FileExists(fileName As String) As Integer
    Dim fso As Object
    Dim folderPath As String
    Dim filePath As String
    
    Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    
    folderPath = "K:\finance\Payroll Folder\MingShun\2-24\Changes to IR8A\Brown" ' Update this with your folder path
    
    If Right(folderPath, 1) <> "\" Then
        folderPath = folderPath & "\"
    End If
    
    filePath = folderPath & fileName & ".pdf"
    
    If fso.FileExists(filePath) Then
        FileExists = 1 ' File exists
    Else
        FileExists = 0 ' File does not exist
    End If
    
    Set fso = Nothing
End Function

----------------------------------------------------------------

After you inserted the vba file, you insert a FORMULA EXCEL to target the cells

=FileExists(B361) < THIS FORMULA EXCEL RIGHT HERE


*Change the B361 to any cell that you want to check in the folder.
