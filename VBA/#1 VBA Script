I used this VBA script to quickly highlight cells, because back then my internship company needed to highlight mismatched figures from different softwares, so a team of assistants was required to highlight cells manually, and to highlight manually such as the action of right clicking a cell and clicking on the preferred color was inefficient. I made a keybind on my mouse (binding CTRL+G on side button) to bind highlight cell with the specific RGB color. I shared this with the team as the audit was within 3 days and we needed to cross-verify an entire database of about 40 thousand values and figures.
We managed to do it a few hours before the deadline. I'm glad this short vba guide helped them out.

This code will allow you to quickly highlight cells by using a macro


                              STEPS ON HOW TO DO IT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open the VBA Editor:

Press Alt + F11 to open the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) editor.

Insert a Module:
In the VBA editor, right-click on "VBAProject (Your Workbook Name)" in the left pane.
Choose Insert -> Module to add a new module.
Copy and Paste the Code:

Copy the VBA code (e.g., the code for applying light green fill color).
Paste the code into the newly created module.
Close the VBA Editor:

Close the VBA editor by clicking the "X" button or pressing

----------------------------------------------------------------

Sub ApplyLightGreenFillColor()
    With Selection.Interior
        .Color = RGB(146, 208, 80) ' RGB values for light green
    End With
End Sub

----------------------------------------------------------------

After inserting the VBA script, need bind keybinds for highlighting cell.

You need to assign a Keyboard Shortcut to the Macro HOW?

1) Open the Excel workbook that contains your macro.

2) Press Alt + F8 to open the "Macro" dialog box.

3) In the "Macro" dialog box, select the macro you want to run (e.g., ApplyLightGreenFillColor).

4) Click the "Options" button.

5) In the "Macro Options" dialog box, enter a letter (or number) in the "Shortcut key" field. For example, you can use "G" for "ApplyGreenFillColor" or any other available key.

6) Click "OK" to close the "Macro Options" dialog box.

7) Click "Cancel" to close the "Macro" dialog box.

Click on a cell that you want to highlight, then afterwards you press the key, for example CTRL + G
