Context:
This code was used back when the new payroll system generated a raw excel file where the insurance to the company did not include a totalsum at the end to payout to
company as a whole and instead had each employee individual insurance. Calculating total insurance to be issued for each company wasted a lot of time since there were
a lot of companies per payroll cycle. This helped payroll executives to save time on manual processes and work more important matters.

Usage:
1 - User selects a column

2 - When the macro runs, an input box appears asking the user to select a column. The user selects Column A. Macro scans Column A from bottom to top

3 - It looks for any cell that contains the word "Insurance" (case-insensitive). When "Insurance" is found, a new row is inserted below it.

Sub InsertRowBelow()
    Dim i As Long
    Dim xLast As Long
    Dim xRng As Range
    Dim xTxt As String

    ' Store the current selection address
    xTxt = Application.ActiveWindow.RangeSelection.Address
    
    ' Ask the user to select a column
    Set xRng = Application.InputBox("Please select the column to check for specific text:", "Insert Row Below", xTxt, , , , , 8)
    
    ' Exit if no range is selected
    If xRng Is Nothing Then Exit Sub

    ' Ensure only one column is selected
    If xRng.Columns.Count > 1 Then
        MsgBox "Please select only one column.", vbExclamation, "Invalid Selection"
        Exit Sub
    End If

    ' Find the last row in the selected column
    xLast = xRng.Rows.Count

    ' Loop from bottom to top to avoid shifting issues when inserting rows
    For i = xLast To 1 Step -1
        If InStr(1, xRng.Cells(i, 1).Value, "Insurance", vbTextCompare) > 0 Then
            Rows(xRng.Cells(i + 1, 1).Row).Insert Shift:=xlDown
        End If
    Next
End Sub
